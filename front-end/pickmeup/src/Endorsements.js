            <p>When I first met my fiance, I never thought she'd agree to go out with me, I mean come on, would you!? I'm not confident, attractive, or funny. Thank god for technology. With the help of the "PickMeUp" app, my lonely nights have turned into island delights. Definitely a must-have for any bachelor looking to settle down.</p>

            <p>Any guy who is worth your time has got to have the best lines. If his pick-up game is weak you know his pull-out is too. Don't trust a homie who can't even download the hottest app on the marketplace. If he ain't buyin' (for the low-low price of $4.99) then you sure as hell shouldn't be supplyin.</p>

            <p>I don't use that app. Haven't had a girlfriend for YEARS. 1/10 would not reccomend going without it.</p>

            <p>When I was younger, I was more than happy to hang out with Palmala Handerson, but now that I'm a fully grown man-child, I require a bit more from my endeavors. Using these real-world tested pick-up lines has changed my life. Girls used to run at the sight of me, and now, when I catch up to them, I can at least make them blush before they either beat me with their purse or call the police. Buy now!</p>
